🤖 Agentic AI Chatbot

Agentic AI Chatbot is an intelligent, dual-mode assistant that allows users to chat using either a basic LLM-powered chatbot or an advanced web-integrated chatbot. Built for flexibility, it supports multiple language models (like Groq, LLaMA, etc.) and offers up-to-date information retrieval via the Tavily Web Search API.
